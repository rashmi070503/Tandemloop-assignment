# Design Assignment – Web UI Sections (Figma)

This repository documents the design assignment completed as part of a UI/UX screening assessment. The task was to create three distinct sections of a web interface using **Figma**: Pricing, Data Visualization, and Feature Highlights.

All designs were created within a **1920px wide canvas** using a consistent typography style with the **Manrope font** applied across all sections for clarity and cohesion.

## Section-wise Breakdown

### 1. Pricing Section

#### Description:
A visually clear pricing section comparing two user plans:
- **Free Plan** (For 1 user)
- **Startup Plan** (₹300 per person, for 10 users)

#### Design Highlights:
- Both plans are structured in horizontally aligned cards.
- Key features such as “Unlimited Meetings”, “Basic/Complete Meetings Module”, and “Mail meeting reports” are included with icons.
- Typography hierarchy is used to separate plan name, pricing, and description.
- Buttons include labels like “Create your account” and “Explore” for user CTA.

#### Hover Interaction:
- The **Startup Plan card** is shown in a **hovered state** to simulate interactive behavior.
- This includes:
  - Visual elevation using shadow
  - Background color enhancement
  - CTA button state change for better user feedback

### 2. Data Visualization Section

#### Description:
This section is meant to showcase data-driven insights using dashboards and KPIs. It was designed in **three distinct layout options** to demonstrate different ways of representing data visually.

---

#### Layout 1: **Donut Chart + Task Tabs**
- Visual focus is on a **donut chart** showing total tasks with completed vs. incomplete breakdown.
- A tabbed interface allows switching between:
  - Task by Employees
  - Task by Property
  - Task Overview
- A legend is displayed beneath the chart with clear labels and color indicators.

---

#### Layout 2: **Horizontal Stacked Bar Chart**
- Uses a horizontal bar chart to show task distribution per user.
- Tabs provide context switching, and colors distinguish task status.
- Good for comparative analysis across team members or properties.

---

#### Layout 3: **Vertical Column Chart**
- Displays tasks as vertical bar groups across time (e.g., quarters).
- Each segment uses distinct colors:
  - Purplish Blue
  - Dragon Pink
- Includes a legend with associated labels.
- Designed for temporal trend visualization and comparative volume analysis.

---

#### Shared Metric Cards:
All layouts contain four key metric cards on the left side:
- **Total Meetings**: Weekly, daily, and today stats
- **Meeting Actions**: Count and small bar graph
- **Visits**: Line chart showing traffic trend
- **Operational Efficiency**: Percentage bar with Week and City ratios

#### Design Comments:
- These three layouts offer flexibility to fit various user needs.
- Tabs simulate UI interactivity without requiring prototyping.
- Colors and spacing enhance readability and hierarchy.

### 3. Features Section

#### Description:
Highlights the platform’s major capabilities in a four-column layout. Designed to communicate core value propositions quickly and clearly.

#### Included Features:
- **MOM Reports**: Automatically mailed meeting notes and overdue reminders
- **Cloud Storage**: Secure, encrypted attachment handling
- **Invite Participants**: Collaborate with users within or outside the organization
- **Powerful Dashboard**: Tracks actions and progress through a central interface

#### Design Style:
- Each feature block includes:
  - A top circular icon
  - Clear headline
  - One-line description
- Light blue backgrounds and shadow elevation help with visual grouping

## Design Process

1. **Requirement Analysis**
   - Understood the goals for each section
   - Identified user interactions and layout expectations

2. **Canvas & Structure Setup**
   - 1920px-wide desktop frame established in Figma
   - Auto-layout used extensively for modular structure

3. **Typography & Spacing**
   - **Manrope** was selected for a clean, legible visual language
   - Font weights adjusted for headings, subtext, and UI components
   - Consistent spacing, padding, and alignment applied throughout

4. **Color & Component Design**
   - Soft gradients and UI shadows used for hierarchy
   - CTA buttons and tags are reused as Figma components
   - All icons align to a neutral but professional design language

5. **Interactivity Preview**
   - Hover states simulated on pricing card
   - Tabs in visualization section designed to look interactive for handoff context

---

## Final Comments

- The **analytics section** presents **three distinct data visualization layouts** to reflect different possible implementations.
- The **pricing section** includes a visually distinct **hover simulation** for one card to show interactivity within a static design.
- A consistent **Manrope font** ensures visual coherence across all frames.
- Every element has been designed to be **developer-friendly** and scalable to other breakpoints or screen sizes with minimal adaptation.

---

## Deliverables

All designs are included within a single Figma file and are organized in labeled frames:

- Pricing Section
- Analytics Dashboard (3 layout options)
- Feature Highlights Section

The assignment reflects both visual design thinking and user-centric layout planning, ready for handoff or prototyping.
